## Summary
Assessment of optimization methods that rely on randomization rather than gradient descent.

## Problem Set
We will be applying Random Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm to optimize the following problems and then assessing both performance and cost efficiency.
- N Queens
- k-Color
